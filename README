For the users

Permissions gives server admins great control, mostly in-game reloading.
Simply use /pr and the file will be re-cached and never touched again until
you need to reload it. This allows you to quickly give your users the commands
that they need without having to restart the server.

Installation

Build the plugin:
$ mvn clean install

Copy the built jar from the target directory to the minecraft plugins
directory.
